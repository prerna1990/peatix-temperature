# Take home test for Peatix Backend Engineer

## Instructions

Write an HTTP API that takes a temperature value in Celcius as input and gives the equivalent temperature in Farenheit as the output. The same API endpoint should also be able to take the temperature in Farenheit and output the equivalent temperature in Celcius. 

# A few notes

- Feel free to use any framework or language that you think will best demonstrate your skills. Please balance this decision with what you think are the most appropriate tools for the given requirements.

- You are free to use any third party libraries that will help you implement the API. 

- It is up to you to decide on the design of the API. This refers to the URL structure, the supported data formats of the input and the output, or any additional features that you think will improve the usability and flexibility of the API. 

- Please spend no more than 1 week in designing and implementing the solution, as it will be due after that. 

- You will be required to submit all the source code that you used to build the API. Please submit the folder containing all your source code as a single zip file. The folder should also contain all the necessary configuration and build scripts. If your framework or tool generates other source files, there is no need to include those. Instead, please include the instructions on how to deploy and build your app in a README or README.md file. Please also omit all the package files, if you use any third party packages. The build tools or scripts should be able to download them automatically. 

- As hinted in the previous item, please include a README file to explain not only how to build and deploy the API, but also the solution that you used. Make sure to include the description on the rationale behind the design and the architecture. It would also be good to explain how you came to the decision on which tools or framework to use. Please do not take this part lightly. It is a very important part of the solution, as written communication is an important part of remote work. 

- You will also be required to provide a URL where a deployed version of the API is running. Please include  the `curl` commands that will allow us to test the API. 

# Optional

If you have enough time remaining, please implement a test suite for the API. Feel free to use any language or test framework for this. It does not necessarily need to be the same language as the one used to implement the API, though it would be nice to use one that is appropriate for the original implementation language.

Please include the discussion for how you implemented the above requirement in the README file. As with the main solution, you should be able to explain the design and architectural decisions that led you to the final solution.
